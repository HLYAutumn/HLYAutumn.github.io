I'm a 2024 Master's student at [the School of Software and Microelectronics](https://www.ss.pku.edu.cn/) , [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/). My research interest includes computer vision, AI4Astro and AI4Med.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Shanghang Zhang](https://www.shanghangzhang.com/) of HMI Lab from [School of Computer Science](https://cs.pku.edu.cn/), Peking University.
