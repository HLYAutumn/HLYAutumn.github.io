 Huang Liyuqiu  
 
I'm a 2024 Master's student at [the School of Software and Microelectronics](https://www.ss.pku.edu.cn/) , [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/), and I holds a bachelor's degree from [the School of Astronomy and Space Science](https://astronomy.nju.edu.cn/) at [Nanjing University](https://www.nju.edu.cn/).

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Shanghang Zhang](https://www.shanghangzhang.com/) of HMI Lab from [School of Computer Science](https://cs.pku.edu.cn/), Peking University.

My research focuses primarily on the application of artificial intelligence in astronomy (AI4Astro) and medicine (AI4Med).
